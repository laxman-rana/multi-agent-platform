# AlphaScannerAgent — Opportunity Scanner

> **Multi-agent platform** › `src/agents/opportunity/` — Live BUY Signal Scanner

> ⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY — NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**
> This agent produces quantitative signals and LLM-derived commentary for learning purposes only.
> Nothing it outputs constitutes financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security.
> **Do not use these signals to make real investment decisions.**

A production-grade, event-driven three-stage agent that scans live market data during NYSE/NSE trading hours and surfaces high-quality **BUY** opportunities. It automatically integrates with `PortfolioAgent` to fetch your real holdings and emit actionable portfolio warnings alongside every recommendation. Each candidate also receives a news sentiment analysis before the final LLM decision.

> **Scope constraint:** This agent only ever outputs `BUY SIGNAL` or `IGNORE`. It has no concept of SELL, REDUCE, or EXIT — those decisions belong exclusively to `PortfolioAgent`.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Market Data Fetch

**File:** `nodes/alpha_scanner_agent.py` → `_fetch_extended(ticker)`

All tickers in the watchlist are fetched **in parallel** using `ThreadPoolExecutor` (up to `_MAX_FETCH_WORKERS` = 10 concurrent threads). Each fetch makes a single `yf.Ticker(ticker).info` call and returns:

| Field            | Source                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `price`          | `currentPrice` / `regularMarketPrice` / `previousClose`     |
| `change_pct`     | Computed from `regularMarketPreviousClose`                  |
| `volatility`     | Annualised std dev from 30-day daily returns                |
| `pe_ratio`       | `trailingPE`                                                |
| `forward_pe`     | `forwardPE`                                                 |
| `52w_high/low`   | `fiftyTwoWeekHigh` / `fiftyTwoWeekLow`                      |
| `sector`         | `info["sector"]` (used for portfolio guardrails)            |
| `volume`         | `regularMarketVolume`                                       |
| `avg_volume`     | `averageVolume` (30-day average)                            |
| `analyst_rating` | `recommendationKey` (e.g. `"buy"`, `"hold"`, `"sell"`)      |
| `analyst_count`  | `numberOfAnalystOpinions`                                   |
| `analyst_target` | `targetMeanPrice` — mean analyst price target (float)       |
| `vol_pressure`   | Derived: `"buying"` / `"selling"` / `"neutral"` (see below) |

**Volume pressure proxy**

`vol_pressure` is derived from price direction × volume spike — no paid Level-2 data needed:

```
volume >= avg_volume × 1.5  AND  change_pct > 0  →  "buying"
volume >= avg_volume × 1.5  AND  change_pct < 0  →  "selling"
otherwise                                          →  "neutral"
```

Tickers that fail to fetch (network error, invalid symbol) are recorded in `state.scan_errors` and silently skipped.

---

### 2. PreFilterEngine

**File:** `engines/prefilter_engine.py`

A lightweight **OR-logic** gate that runs before the scoring engine. A ticker passes if **any one** condition is true. The goal is to discard clearly uninteresting tickers at zero LLM cost when scanning large watchlists (100+ tickers).

| Condition                       | Threshold       | Rationale                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `abs(change_pct) > 3.0%`        | 3.0             | Meaningful intraday price movement        |
| Price in lower 20% of 52w range | 20th percentile | Potential value-entry zone                |
| `volume > avg_volume × 1.5`     | 1.5×            | Unusual institutional or retail interest  |
| `volatility > 35%`              | 0.35 annualised | Elevated risk warrants closer examination |

A ticker with no price data is unconditionally rejected. All thresholds are defined in `_PREFILTER_THRESHOLDS` — no magic numbers in logic.

---

### 3. SignalEngine

**File:** `engines/signal_engine.py`

Deterministic quantitative scoring applied to every ticker that passed the prefilter. Eight signals fire independently using a configurable `_WEIGHTS` dict; their points are summed into a final score.

| Signal             | Condition                                             | Weight | Rationale                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `pe_improvement`   | `forward_pe < pe_ratio`                               | **+1** | Earnings growth expected — valuation improving    |
| `52w_lower_band`   | Price in lower 30% of 52w range                       | **+1** | Potential value-entry zone                        |
| `analyst_bullish`  | `buy`/`strong_buy`, ≥ 3 analysts, ≥ 20% target upside | **+1** | Wall Street consensus supports new entry          |
| `buying_pressure`  | price up + volume ≥ 1.5× avg                          | **+1** | Institutional accumulation proxy                  |
| `capitulation`     | price ≤ −8% + volume ≥ 3× avg                         | **+2** | Panic exhaustion — mean-reversion entry zone      |
| `near_52w_high`    | Price within 5% of 52w high                           | **−1** | Chasing strength — unfavourable entry risk/reward |
| `analyst_bearish`  | `underperform`/`sell`, ≥ 3 analysts                   | **−1** | Professional consensus against new entry          |
| `selling_pressure` | price ≤ −8% without panic volume                      | **−1** | Distribution signal without exhaustion            |
| `volatility`       | `volatility > 35%` (suppressed during capitulation)   | **−1** | Elevated entry risk penalty                       |

> **Capitulation suppresses volatility penalty:** During a capitulation event (drop ≥8% on ≥3× volume), high volatility is expected and already captured by the +2 signal — penalising it a second time would unfairly double-count the same risk.

**Tier mapping (raised for selectivity):**

| Score | Tier           |
| ----- | -------------- |
| ≥ +3  | `"strong_buy"` |
| ≥ +2  | `"buy"`        |
| ≤ +1  | `"neutral"`    |
| < 0   | `"avoid"`      |

**Opportunity type — deterministic, not LLM-derived:**

| Condition                        | Type         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `52w_lower_band` signal fired    | `"dip_buy"`  |
| Only `pe_improvement` fired      | `"value"`    |
| Neither fundamental signal fired | `"momentum"` |

**Output per ticker:**

```python
{
    "score":   int,        # net weighted signal total
    "signals": List[str],  # human-readable descriptions including weights
    "tier":    str,        # "strong_buy" | "buy" | "neutral" | "avoid"
    "type":    str,        # "dip_buy" | "value" | "momentum"
}
```

---

### 3a. Opportunity Score (composite ranking)

**File:** `nodes/alpha_scanner_agent.py` → `_compute_opportunity_score()`

After scoring, each qualified ticker receives a **composite ranking metric** that blends four orthogonal dimensions into a single float in `[0.0, 1.0]`:

```
opportunity_score =
    0.4 × normalized_signal_score   (raw_score / 5.0)
  + 0.3 × analyst_upside            (50% upside = 1.0, clamped)
  + 0.2 × volume_spike              (10× avg volume = 1.0, clamped)
  + 0.1 × freshness                 (1.0 = new idea, 0.0 = in recent_signal_context)
```

This composite is used for **ranking before the cooldown gate** — highest `opportunity_score` first. Two tickers at the same raw signal score (e.g., both `+3`) are now differentiated by analyst upside and volume spike. The `opportunity_score` is stored in the signal dict, in `buy_entry`, and printed in the output.

---

### 4. Candidate Filter

**File:** `nodes/alpha_scanner_agent.py`

Two conditions must both hold for a ticker to advance to the news and decision stages:

1. **Score ≥ `_CANDIDATE_MIN_SCORE`** (default: 2) — tier must be `"buy"` or `"strong_buy"`
2. **Cooldown clear** — the ticker must not have emitted a BUY signal within the configured cooldown window

Tickers are sorted by `opportunity_score` descending **before** the cooldown gate, so the highest-conviction ideas always compete first regardless of dict iteration order.

**Configurable cooldown unit** (`_COOLDOWN_UNIT`):

| Unit      | Effective window                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `minutes` | `_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` minutes (default: 30, intraday) |
| `hours`   | `_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` hours (hourly scan cadence)     |
| `days`    | `_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` calendar days (daily cadence)   |

Cooldown state is carried forward between batch-scan cycles via `state.recent_signals`.

**Freshness bypass (`_is_fresh_despite_cooldown`):** A ticker inside its cooldown window re-enters the candidate list if a new material catalyst has emerged:

- Capitulation event fires (drop ≥8% on ≥3× avg volume) — panic exhaustion is always a fresh setup
- Price has dropped ≥5% since the price recorded at the last BUY signal (new lower entry zone)

Bypassed tickers are tagged `override_reason = "fresh_catalyst"` in the signal dict.

---

### 5. Portfolio-Awareness Guards

**File:** `nodes/alpha_scanner_agent.py`, `nodes/decision_node.py`

#### Auto-fetching portfolio context

When the agent starts, `_fetch_portfolio_context()` automatically runs the existing `PortfolioAgent` pipeline:

```
PortfolioAgent → loads positions
MarketAgent    → fetches live prices for each holding
RiskAgent      → computes sector_allocation and stock_allocation %
```

This ensures allocation percentages are based on **current market prices**, not historical cost basis.

#### Cash check (opt-in hard stop)

By default (`ignore_cash_check=True`), the agent runs regardless of `cash_available` — useful for signal research and paper trading. Pass `ignore_cash_check=False` or use `--enforce-cash` on the CLI to enable the hard stop:

```bash
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 50 --once --enforce-cash
```

When enforced: if `portfolio_context["cash_available"] <= 0`, all LLM calls are skipped, candidates are recorded in `state.blocked_no_cash`, and an empty result is returned.

#### Warnings, not filters

All other cap checks surface as **warnings in the output** rather than silently removing tickers:

| Condition                                     | Severity | Warning label           |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `position > _MAX_POSITION_WEIGHT` (10%)       | ⚠️       | `POSITION CAP EXCEEDED` |
| `position > _MAX_POSITION_WEIGHT × 0.8` (8%)  | ⚠️       | `CONCENTRATION RISK`    |
| `sector_alloc > _MAX_SECTOR_EXPOSURE` (60%)`  | ⚠️       | `SECTOR CAP EXCEEDED`   |
| `sector_alloc > _SECTOR_TARGET_WEIGHT` (20%)` | ⚠️       | `SECTOR OVERWEIGHT`     |

---

### 6. NewsNode — Sentiment Analysis

**File:** `nodes/news_node.py`

A dedicated LangGraph node that runs **after** candidates are filtered and **before** the LLM decision. Only candidates (score ≥ 1, cooldown clear) receive news analysis — fetching headlines for every ticker in a 200-stock universe would be wasteful.

**Processing per ticker:**

1. Fetch up to `_MAX_HEADLINES` (5) recent news titles via `yf.Ticker(ticker).news`
2. Send headlines to the LLM with a strict analyst-prompt
3. Parse structured JSON response

**Output per ticker written to `state.news_sentiment`:**

```python
{
    "sentiment":      "positive" | "neutral" | "negative",
    "catalyst":       "One-sentence primary driver.",
    "headline_count": int   # number of headlines found
}
```

**Concurrency:** Up to `_MAX_NEWS_WORKERS` (3) parallel threads, capped further by `OllamaProvider.max_concurrency = 1`.

**Fallback:** Any fetch or LLM failure returns `{"sentiment": "neutral", "catalyst": "No recent news found.", "headline_count": 0}` — the scan never halts on a single ticker failure.

---

### 7. OpportunityDecisionAgent (LLM)

**File:** `engines/decision_agent.py`, `nodes/decision_node.py`

A per-ticker LLM call that produces a structured `BUY` or `IGNORE` verdict. The LLM receives four enriched context blocks:

| Context block      | Source                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantitative score | SignalEngine — score, tier, fired signals               |
| Market data        | `_fetch_extended` — price, PE, vol, 52w                 |
| Analyst consensus  | `analyst_rating`, `analyst_count`, `analyst_target`     |
| Volume pressure    | `vol_pressure` — `BUYING / SELLING / NEUTRAL`           |
| News sentiment     | `NewsNode` — `POSITIVE / NEUTRAL / NEGATIVE` + catalyst |

**Parallelisation and caching** (in `DecisionNode`):

All candidates are dispatched concurrently using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, capped by `min(candidates, provider.max_concurrency, _MAX_LLM_WORKERS)`. For Ollama this resolves to 1 (sequential); for cloud providers it runs up to 5 in parallel. An **instance-level short-TTL cache** avoids redundant LLM round-trips:

- **Cache key:** `"{ticker}:{score}:{type}"`
- **TTL:** `_DECISION_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES` (default: 15 minutes)

**Output JSON (4 LLM-derived fields — `type` is injected from SignalEngine):**

```json
{
    "action":        "BUY" | "IGNORE",
    "confidence":    "high" | "moderate" | "low",
    "entry_quality": "strong" | "moderate" | "weak",
    "reason":        "one concise sentence referencing score tier and key signals"
}
```

| Field           | Values                           | Description                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `action`        | `BUY` \| `IGNORE`                | The only two permitted outputs     |
| `confidence`    | `high` \| `moderate` \| `low`    | Conviction level                   |
| `entry_quality` | `strong` \| `moderate` \| `weak` | Entry risk/reward profile          |
| `reason`        | string                           | Factual one-sentence justification |

> `type` (`dip_buy` | `value` | `momentum`) is determined by SignalEngine — never by the LLM. This ensures reproducible, deterministic opportunity classification.

**Error handling:** Any JSON parse failure or LLM exception returns a safe `IGNORE / low / weak` fallback — the scan never crashes on a single ticker.

---

### 8. Sort, Cap, and Emit

**File:** `nodes/decision_node.py`

BUY decisions are sorted by two keys:

1. **Confidence rank** — `high` (0) → `moderate` (1) → `low` (2)
2. **Effective opportunity score descending** — `opportunity_score + fit_boost` within the same confidence band

After sorting, the list is **capped at `_MAX_CONCURRENT_BUYS` (default: 3)** — only the highest-conviction setups are emitted per cycle.

**Position sizing:** Each BUY entry receives a `suggested_position_size = cash_available / _MAX_CONCURRENT_BUYS` when cash is finite and positive.

#### Portfolio-fit ranking boost

Tickers in sectors currently **underweight** relative to `_SECTOR_TARGET_WEIGHT` (default 20%) receive a ranking bonus. This surfaces diversification opportunities without altering the raw score:

```python
fit_boost = max(0.0, _SECTOR_TARGET_WEIGHT - current_sector_pct) * _SECTOR_UNDERWEIGHT_BOOST
# Example: sector at 10% → gap = 10% → boost = 10 × 0.5 = +5 effective points
```

The raw `score` in the output always reflects quantitative signals only.

---

## State Object

**File:** `state.py` — `OpportunityState` dataclass

All pipeline stages read from and write to a single shared state object.

| Field                   | Type              | Written by    | Description                                                        |

### `portfolio_context` schema

```python
{
    "sector_allocation":  {"Technology": 45.2, "Healthcare": 12.0},  # sector → %
    "position_weights":   {"AAPL": 8.5, "MSFT": 6.2},               # ticker → %
    "cash_available":     15000.0,                                    # deployable capital
    "total_positions":    12,
    "top_holding_weight": 8.5,
}
```

All fields are optional. Missing fields default to safe values (`cash_available` defaults to `inf` so the agent runs without portfolio context).

---

## Output Format

The final `buy_opportunities` list is sorted by confidence then effective score descending. Each entry includes quantitative signals, news context, and portfolio warnings:

```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "action": "BUY SIGNAL",
    "confidence": "high",
    "entry_quality": "moderate",
    "reason": "Score +3 with forward P/E below trailing, price near 52-week low, and analyst upside.",
    "type": "dip_buy",
    "score": 3,
    "opportunity_score": 0.6812,
    "signals": [
      "Forward P/E (19.0) < Trailing P/E (22.5) → earnings growth expected",
      "Price in lower 30% of 52w range (7%) → potential value entry",

    ],
    "portfolio_hints": [
      "ℹ️  TIGHT CAPITAL: 18% of portfolio capital available. Recommend max 5.0% position size."
    ]
  }
]
```

### Portfolio Context fields

Each BUY entry carries `portfolio_warnings` and `portfolio_hints`. All 12 scenarios:

| Scenario                     | Condition                                       | Output type | Label                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Position cap exceeded        | `current_position > _MAX_POSITION_WEIGHT` (10%) | ⚠️ warning  | `POSITION CAP EXCEEDED`       |
| Approaching position cap     | `current_position > 8%`                         | ⚠️ warning  | `CONCENTRATION RISK`          |
| Existing position within cap | `current_position > 0` and ≤ 8%                 | ℹ️ hint     | current position info         |
| New position                 | `current_position == 0`                         | ✓ hint      | `NEW POSITION`                |
| Sector hard cap exceeded     | `sector_alloc > _MAX_SECTOR_EXPOSURE` (60%)     | ⚠️ warning  | `SECTOR CAP EXCEEDED`         |
| Sector overweight            | `sector_alloc > _SECTOR_TARGET_WEIGHT` (20%)    | ⚠️ warning  | `SECTOR OVERWEIGHT`           |
| Sector underweight           | gap > 5% below target                           | ✓ hint      | `DIVERSIFICATION OPPORTUNITY` |
| Sector neutral               | within 5% of target                             | ℹ️ hint     | `SECTOR FIT`                  |
| Limited capital              | `cash_pct < 10%`                                | ⚠️ warning  | `LIMITED CAPITAL`             |

| Capital available            | `cash_pct > 25%`                                | ✓ hint      | `CAPITAL AVAILABLE`           |
| Unlimited capital            | `cash_available == inf`                         | ✓ hint      | `UNLIMITED CAPITAL`           |

### CLI output format

Each BUY signal is printed in three clearly separated sections:

```
============================================================
ALPHA SCANNER — SIGNALS DETECTED (1 found)
============================================================

============================================================
ALPHA SIGNAL — OPPORTUNITY DETECTED
============================================================

  Ticker        : MSFT
  Signal        : BUY SIGNAL
  Confidence    : high
  Entry Quality : strong
  Score         : +3
  Type          : dip_buy
  Sector        : Technology  (held: 0.0%  |  sector alloc: 45.0%)

  News          : POSITIVE  —  Azure revenue beat estimates by 8%.

  Quantitative Signals:
      - Forward P/E (19.0) < Trailing P/E (22.5) → earnings growth expected
      - Price in lower 30% of 52w range (7%) → potential value entry
      - Analyst consensus: buy (14 analysts, target $480, +22% upside)

  Reason:
  Score +3 (strong_buy tier): multiple confirming signals with analyst upside.

------------------------------------------------------------
PORTFOLIO CONSTRAINTS (Advisory)
------------------------------------------------------------

  ✓ NEW POSITION: MSFT not currently held; clean entry opportunity.
  ✓ CAPITAL AVAILABLE: 42% deployable. Full sizing up to 10% is possible.

------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTION STATUS
------------------------------------------------------------

  Actionable    : YES

  Suggested size: $5,000  (cash ÷ 3 max buys)

  Suggested Actions:
      - Execute BUY for MSFT
      - Limit position to $5,000
      - Set stop-loss below 52-week low

============================================================
```

**Actionable** is automatically `YES` when no hard-cap portfolio warnings fired, `NO` otherwise — with situation-specific remediation steps.

## Observability & Telemetry

**Provider:** Traceloop SDK via `src.observability.get_telemetry_logger()`

Seven telemetry events are emitted per scan cycle:

| Event                 | When emitted                      | Key payload fields                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scan_start`          | Before any fetch                  | `watchlist_size`, `timestamp`                                                                                                                        |
| `prefilter_complete`  | After PreFilterEngine             | `total`, `passed`, `filtered_out`, `latency_ms`                                                                                                      |
| `signals_generated`   | After SignalEngine                | `scored`, `strong_buy_tier`, `buy_tier`, `neutral_tier`, `avoid_tier`, `latency_ms`                                                                  |
| `candidates_filtered` | After candidate + cooldown filter | `candidate_count`, `filtered_count`, `skipped_cooldown`                                                                                              |
| `llm_decision`        | Per ticker, after LLM call        | `ticker`, `score`, `action`, `confidence`, `latency_ms`                                                                                              |
| `buy_signal_emitted`  | Per BUY result                    | `ticker`, `score`, `confidence`, `entry_quality`, `type`, `sector`, `current_position_pct`, `sector_allocation_pct`, `warnings_count`, `hints_count` |
| `scan_summary`        | End of every scan cycle           | `watchlist_size`, `fetched`, `prefiltered`, `scored`, `candidates`, `approved`, `buy_opportunities`, `step_latencies_ms`, `buy_tickers`              |

#### Per-step latency tracking

Every pipeline stage is timed with `time.monotonic()`. The `scan_summary` event contains `step_latencies_ms`:

```json
{
  "step_latencies_ms": {
    "fetch_ms": 423.0,
    "prefilter_ms": 1.2,
    "signal_ms": 0.8,
    "news_ms": 1250.0,
    "llm_total_ms": 3521.0,
    "total_ms": 5196.0
  }
}
```

Telemetry is non-blocking — a missing or disabled `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` downgrades to a no-op logger.

---

## Running the Agent

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install yfinance langchain-core langgraph
# Plus one of the LLM provider packages:
pip install langchain-ollama    # for Ollama (default)
pip install langchain-openai    # for OpenAI
pip install langchain-google-genai  # for Google Gemini
```

---

### CLI — Single Scan

Run once and print results. Useful for testing outside market hours.

```bash
# Explicit watchlist
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --tickers AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL META --once

# Dynamic universe — top 50 S&P 500 constituents (US, default)
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 50 --once

# Enforce cash guard (hard-stop when portfolio has no deployable capital)
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 50 --once --enforce-cash

# Verbose — per-ticker pipeline digest table after the scan
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 50 --once --verbose

# Indian large cap — NIFTY 50
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 50 --market IN --once

# Indian mid cap — NIFTY MIDCAP 100
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 100 --market IN_MID --once

# Indian small cap — NIFTY SMALLCAP 100
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 100 --market IN_SMALL --once

# Override LLM model (provider auto-inferred)
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 100 --market IN_MID --model gpt-4o --once
```

Either `--tickers` or `--top-n` is required. `--market` defaults to `US`.

---

### CLI — Continuous Batch Scan

Runs automatically while the market is open. Scans every 15 minutes by default.

```bash
# US market, explicit watchlist, default interval (15 min)
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --tickers AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL META AMZN TSLA

# US dynamic universe, every 5 minutes
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 100 --interval 5

# Indian large cap (NIFTY 50), every 10 minutes
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 50 --market IN --interval 10

# Indian mid cap (NIFTY MIDCAP 100), every 15 minutes
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 100 --market IN_MID --interval 15

# Indian small cap (NIFTY SMALLCAP 100), every 15 minutes
python -m src.agents.opportunity.workflow --top-n 100 --market IN_SMALL --interval 15
```

The process exits automatically when the market closes. Cooldown state persists across cycles.

---

### Programmatic API

#### Single-shot

```python
from src.agents.opportunity.workflow import trigger_scan

opportunities = trigger_scan(
    tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA", "META", "GOOGL"],
    portfolio_context={
        "sector_allocation": {"Technology": 48.0, "Healthcare": 12.0},
        "position_weights":  {"AAPL": 9.0, "MSFT": 12.4},
        "cash_available":    20000.0,
    },
)

for opp in opportunities:
    print(f"{opp['ticker']} — {opp['confidence']} | news: {opp.get('news_sentiment')}")
    print(f"  catalyst: {opp.get('news_catalyst')}")
    for w in opp.get("portfolio_warnings", []):
        print(f"  {w}")
```

#### Dynamic universe helper

```python
from src.agents.opportunity.markets.market_strategy import get_liquid_universe

us_tickers  = get_liquid_universe(n=100, market="US")       # top 100 S&P 500
in_tickers  = get_liquid_universe(n=50,  market="IN")       # NIFTY 50
mid_tickers = get_liquid_universe(n=100, market="IN_MID")   # NIFTY MIDCAP 100
sml_tickers = get_liquid_universe(n=100, market="IN_SMALL") # NIFTY SMALLCAP 100
```

#### Continuous batch loop

```python
from src.agents.opportunity.workflow import run_batch_scan

run_batch_scan(tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA", "META"], interval_minutes=15)
# Blocks until market closes
```

#### Market hours check

```python
from src.agents.opportunity.workflow import is_market_open

if is_market_open("US"):
    run_scan()
```

## Real-Time & Event-Driven Behavior

### Batch Mode (default)

```
while market_open():
    tickers = get_watchlist()
    run_alpha_scan(tickers)
    sleep(interval_minutes * 60)
```

`recent_signals` bridges scan cycles so the cooldown is enforced **across** iterations.

### Event-Driven Mode

`trigger_scan()` is a stateless single-call function designed to be invoked by any external trigger:

```python
@app.post("/hooks/price-spike")
async def on_price_spike(event: PriceSpikeEvent):
    opportunities = trigger_scan(
        tickers=[event.ticker],
        portfolio_context=get_live_portfolio_context(),
    )
    if opportunities:
        notify_trader(opportunities)
```

Other trigger patterns: volatility alerts, earnings calendar, index rebalance events.

## Design Decisions

| Decision                                                 | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **3-node LangGraph graph (scanner → news → decision)**   | Each node has one responsibility. NewsNode can be disabled or swapped independently. DecisionNode isolation makes it easy to replace the LLM without touching fetch or signal logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **NewsNode only for candidates**                         | Fetching headlines + running LLM for every ticker in a 200-stock universe adds ~200 LLM calls per scan. Running news only on candidates (score ≥ 1) keeps cost proportional to signal quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Analyst signals in SignalEngine, not LLM prompt only** | Analyst consensus is a quantitative fact (rating + count + target). Encoding it as a scored signal (+1/−1) means it affects the tier and candidate filter deterministically, not just LLM verdict probability.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Vol pressure proxy from free data**                    | Level-2 order flow requires a paid data feed. Price direction × volume spike is a free, reproducible proxy for institutional buy/sell pressure available in every yfinance info call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`engines/`, `nodes/`, `markets/` subfolders**          | Groups files by responsibility: engines are pure computation (no I/O, no graph nodes); nodes are LangGraph-runnable pipeline stages; markets isolate exchange-specific schedules and universes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **PreFilterEngine before SignalEngine**                  | At 500+ tickers, running 8 signals and LLM on every ticker is expensive. The prefilter drops uninteresting tickers with zero scoring cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Volatility weight = −2**                               | A weight of −1 let `pe_improvement (+1) + 52w_lower_band (+1) + volatility (−1) = +1` pass. At −2 the net is 0 (neutral) and the ticker does not advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Type from SignalEngine, not LLM**                      | `dip_buy / value / momentum` is inferred from which fundamental signals fired. Deterministic inference is reproducible across providers and immune to prompt drift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Warnings, not filters for cap breaches**               | Silently removing a ticker creates invisible blind spots. A `⚠️ POSITION CAP EXCEEDED` warning in the output is more actionable than hiding the recommendation entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Auto-fetch via PortfolioAgent pipeline**               | Running `PortfolioAgent → MarketAgent → RiskAgent` ensures allocation % use current market prices. Without `MarketAgent`, a 15-share MSFT position at avg_cost $403 appears ~40% of a $15k portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **LLM parallelisation + short-TTL cache**                | 5 concurrent decision threads reduce wall-clock time from N×3.5s to ~3.5s. The 15-min cache prevents redundant API calls for the same ticker in the same signal state across repeated intraday scans.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Portfolio-fit boost on rank, not raw score**           | Underweight sectors surface higher in the sorted list without corrupting the raw signal score. The `score` field in output always reflects quantitative signals only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`zoneinfo` over `pytz`**                               | `zoneinfo` is Python 3.9+ stdlib — zero extra dependency, identical capability for NYSE/NSE hours checking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`OllamaProvider.max_concurrency = 1`**                 | Ollama returns HTTP 429 when multiple requests arrive simultaneously. All three LLM call sites — `DecisionNode`, `NewsNode`, `OpportunityDecisionAgent` — cap workers via `min(candidates, provider.max_concurrency, _MAX_LLM_WORKERS)`. A secondary 3-attempt exponential-backoff retry (2 s → 4 s) in `OpportunityDecisionAgent` and `_summarise_news` handles any 429 that slips through on cloud providers. |

## Integration with PortfolioAgent

The two agents are complementary and non-overlapping:

| Concern                                         | Agent                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Scan for new BUY entries                        | **AlphaScannerAgent**                    |
| Manage existing holdings (HOLD / REDUCE / EXIT) | **PortfolioAgent**                       |
| Risk calculation for existing portfolio         | **RiskAgent** (via PortfolioAgent graph) |

#### Automatic integration (default)

When `portfolio_context` is not supplied, the workflow calls `_fetch_portfolio_context()` automatically:

```
PortfolioAgent  →  loads positions from mock_data / brokerage API
MarketAgent     →  fetches live prices for each holding
RiskAgent       →  computes sector_allocation and stock_allocation %
                   using current market values, not avg_cost
```

#### Manual override

Supply `portfolio_context` directly to bypass the auto-fetch (faster for tests):

```python
from src.agents.opportunity.workflow import trigger_scan

opportunities = trigger_scan(
    tickers=["META", "NVDA", "AMZN", "GOOGL"],
    portfolio_context={
        "sector_allocation": {"Technology": 68.3, "Financials": 15.0},
        "position_weights":  {"MSFT": 12.4, "NVDA": 9.1},
        "cash_available":    18000.0,
    },
)
```

#### Feeding from a completed PortfolioAgent run

```python
from src.agents.portfolio.workflow import build_graph as build_portfolio_graph
from src.agents.portfolio.state import PortfolioState
from src.agents.opportunity.workflow import trigger_scan

portfolio_result = build_portfolio_graph().invoke(PortfolioState())

opportunities = trigger_scan(
    tickers=["META", "NVDA", "AMZN", "GOOGL"],
    portfolio_context={
        "sector_allocation": portfolio_result.sector_allocation,
        "position_weights":  portfolio_result.risk_metrics.get("stock_allocation", {}),
        "cash_available":    portfolio_result.risk_metrics.get("cash_balance", 0.0),
    },
)
```
